# Widget-Attributes
 Use attributes to createwidgets and labels ("handles") in the scene view, to visualise and manipulate data in the Scene View.

Currently it only works with Vector2, Vector 3 and Rect fields.
It currently only works for monobehaviours, and uses a custom Editor for the type monobehaviour. This includes child classes of the monobehaviour

Style attributes can be used on any field and make changes for the current field and any proceeding fields.

See the samples for some ideas.

More documentation to come soon.
